            <h2>Introduction to Treaty 3</h2>
            <p>Treaty 3 was signed on October 3, 1873, between the Crown and the Ojibwe Nation. This agreement aimed to support settlement in Canada while respecting Indigenous rights to their lands.</p>
            <p>The treaty covers a large area, including parts of modern Ontario and Manitoba, and it allows the Ojibwe people to hunt, fish, and gather in their traditional territories.</p>

            <h2>Location of Negotiation</h2>
            <p>Treaty 3 was negotiated at the northwest shore of Lake of the Woods. This location was important for many Indigenous groups and European settlers.</p>
            <p>Lake of the Woods is still a cultural area for the Indigenous communities involved in Treaty 3.</p>

            <h2>Historic Terms of Treaty 3</h2>
            <p>The treaty included the transfer of land to the Crown in exchange for several promises, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Money for the lands given up.</li>
                <li>Rights to hunt and fish in their traditional areas.</li>
                <li>Support for education and healthcare for the Ojibwe communities.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Treaty 3 is special because it was one of the first treaties to focus on Indigenous rights to natural resources, highlighting their importance to the Ojibwe way of life.</p>
